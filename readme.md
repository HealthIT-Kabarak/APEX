OVERCOMING RESOURCE ALLOCATION CHALLENGES IN KENYA

We used Machine Learning to make a Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib to predict the future commodity trends of the demand of  malaria commodities.



Getting Started
This model has the following dependencies:

NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn

This project was inspired by the challenge of restocking malaria commodities in health facilities across the country.

Special thanks to the Ministry of Health for providing the data used to train this model.

We are on the process of deployment and my browser settings had an issue because I could not access the server due to some setting 

the index.html file is in templates

We are working on the deployment of the model on github pages by configuring docker to the repository
storymap is a repo for data story telling
